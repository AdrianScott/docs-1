## What is an NFT?

***

An NFT (non-fungible token) is a ["digital certificate of ownership"](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56371912) for physical or non-physical assets. This digital certificate possesses many of the same benefits as physical deeds, titles, and contracts but instead of being verified and maintained by a central authority (government or enterprise), NFT's are secured by peer-to-peer networks known as blockchains. NFT's can represent any type of asset whether it be physical as with land, houses, and cars or non-physical as with music, investment shares, and ideas. Properties of NFT’s can be related to an abstract of title, will and authentication of parties, protection from modification, and record of contract.

### Abstract of Title
An abstract of title contains a history of ownership and any applicable leans or other owner-based affects.
To receive an abstract of title one must be NFT's contain a full history of ownership and identification of any applied affects, but this information is stored in public records that can be validated by reviewing the underlying blockchain.

### Will and Authentication
The will and authentication of parties is generally conducted by a licensed notary who verifies that the seller and purchaser of the asset are in their right minds and have the authority to transact. NFT's incorporate this verification using digital signatures which are validated and stored on the blockchain. These signatures are unique to the specific parties involved and cannot be falsified by any other party.

### Modification Protection
Protection from modification is traditionally ensured by the central authority and generally relies on the central authority recording the deed and only allowing modifications by the current owner of the deed. This protection is innate to NFTs via the smart contract that created the NFTs. The smart contract defines all possible modifications that owners can make to the NFT, but this is generally limited to the sale of the NFT itself.

### Record of Contract
The record of contract for NFTs is one of the most important aspects as this record makes possible most other security features. Deeds are generally recorded by a central authority who has full responsibility to maintain, authenticate, and update the records. NFT's are recorded on their underlying blockchain with maintenance, authentication, and updates being verified by the blockchain itself.

## Types of NFTs

NFT's are being used for artwork, music, fashion, real estate, cars, and much more but these use cases can be broken down into three main categories: meme, art, and utility. It is worth noting that NFTs can fall within one or more categories based on its function and these categories are non-exhaustive as NFT's are being created with new functionality each day.

### Meme

>"Memes have always been posted to enhance the social media discourse for fun. Now, unique meme creators can participate in an evolving NFT ecosystem by showcasing their memes as NFTs". [NFT Creator](https://nft-creator.co/nft/types-of-nfts/)


Converting memes into NFT’s ensures the creator receives proper credit and provides a means for the public to compensate the creator for the meme. Some famous memes sold as NFTs include [Nyan cat](https://www.businessinsider.com/ethereum-nft-meme-art-nyan-cat-sells-for-300-eth-2021-2) - $600,000, [Doge](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/iconic-doge-meme-nft-breaks-records-selling-roughly-4-million-n1270161) - $4,000,000 , and [Charlie bit me](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-57333990) - $760,000. Many of the memes that can be purchased as NFTs are still available for the public to view but the owner of the NFT is the only true owner of that meme. NFT projects will predetermine and make available the licensing rules and restrictions associated with the NFT but owning a meme NFT is akin to collecting other artwork: others may have the ability to create copies, but the original remains unique and more valuable.

### Art

Art NFTs represent physical or digital artwork including paintings, photographs, music, movies, and more. Creating art NFTs not only provides the creator a means to profit on their artwork but it also establishes another platform for their artwork to be sold. The creator of art NFTs generally determines their media prior to creating the NFT with some artists preferring strictly digital artwork, others using NFTs to represent physical artwork, and some who merge the two ideas together. Examples of digital art NFT's are [Everydays: The First 5000 Days](https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924) created and sold by Beeple for $70,000,000 , Whitney Houston created a song [OneOf One NFT](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/whitney-houston-nft-collection-unreleased-song-demo-1258758/) which sold for $999,999 , and [Silver Moon Studio](https://silvermoon.studio/about) is converting physical artwork into immersive digital art.

### Utility

Utility NFT's represent assets that have a specific function including event tickets, deeds, video game assets, etc. Releasing utility NFT's allows the creator to distribute their asset in a new platform, ensure security for their utility, and authenticate those who are utilizing the asset. Examples of functionality for utility NFTs are the [Hoseo University](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/south-korean-university-issue-nfts-032142269.html) in South Korea is transitioning from paper-based diplomas to NFT-based diplomas, [Etherland](https://etherland.world/about-the-worlds-metaverse/) is converting physical real estate documents into NFT secured digital files, and [DC Comics](https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2022/03/11/cartamundi-launches-dc-hybrid-physical-and-nft-trading-cards) is releasing physical trading cards that come with associated NFT’s.
