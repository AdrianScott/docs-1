We have completed the first step integrating the [Goby Web Wallet](https://www.goby.app) into [MintGarden](https://mintgarden.io)! You can now take offers for [NFT tokens](https://xch.gallery/cats) directly in the browser.

<!--truncate-->

### Requirements

1. A supported browser (e.g. Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Chromium)
2. [Goby extension](https://www.goby.app) installed and wallet created


### Usage

1. Click `Connect Wallet` in top right corner to link Goby wallet to [MintGarden](https://mintgarden.io)
2. Click `Take Offer` on any of the offers to accept it using Goby

### Limitations
The Goby integration is live on mainnet meaning it CANNOT be used to create testnet NFTs.
This integration currently allows users to accept NFT CAT offers directly from the [MintGarden NFT token](https://mintgarden.io/cats) page.

Let us know in [Discord](https://discord.gg/FJt6ZRYyyS) if you have any questions or run into issues connecting.
Do note that we are continuing to work with the Goby team to ensure a seamless NFT minting process is available for mainnet launch.
