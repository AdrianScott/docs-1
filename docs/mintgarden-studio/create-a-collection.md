#### Name and Description

This information is prominently displayed on explorers and marketplaces.

#### Attributes

If you want to specify attributes in your NFT, you can define the attribute names here. You can then fill in the attribute values for each individual NFT on the minting page.

#### License URL

By assigning a license to the NFT, buyers of your NFTs will directly see what rights they will receive when owning your
NFTs.
The content of your license will largely depend on what you as the creator want to achieve.

Some licenses used by other projects:

* [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/2014/01/07/plaintext-versions-of-creative-commons-4-0-licenses/)
* [CantBeEvil licenses](https://github.com/a16z/a16z-contracts#cantbeevil-license)
* Custom licenses such as the [Marmotverse License](https://assets.marmotverse.io/spacemarmots/marmotverse_license.pdf)

When in doubt, consult a lawyer to pick the right license for your project. This is not legal advice.
